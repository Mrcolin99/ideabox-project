# Challenges and Wins
Communication was definitely a win for our group. We were great about checking in with each other frequently about what we were working on and when we wanted to meet to go over our progress.
Some challenges for our group were setting up the card grid so that it displayed the way we intended it to, organizing and keeping track of git branches, finding the solution to connect ids from all of the cards to the cards that would be deleted.
We overcame these challenges by starting with individual research and then reaching out for help after a specified amount of time. After we were able to identify the container issue we were able to fix the grid display.
This experience will benefit us in future projects because we will be apply to better orgainize our git branches to reduce merge conflicts, recognize when to ask for help sooner, and be able to connect ids in future projects using the same method from this one.
